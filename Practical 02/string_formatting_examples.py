# the manual way of formatting text (using string concatenation):
print("My guitar: " + name + ", was first made in " + str(year) + "!")

# the first special way of formatting text (using 'str.format()'):

print("My guitar: {0}, was first made in {1} (Yeah! {1}!)!".format(name, year))

# the second special way of formatting text (using f-string formatting [f""]):
print(f"My {name} was first made in {year} (Yeah! {year}!)!")

# formatting currency (grouping with comma, round to 2 decimal places):
print("My {} would cost ${:,.2f}!".format(name, cost))
